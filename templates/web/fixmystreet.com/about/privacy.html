<h1>Privacy, cookies, and third party services</h1>

<p><strong>Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you
should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below,
and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many
other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make
our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites,
but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially
positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full.
If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with
other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.

<h2>Privacy</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, we pass on your details, and details of
the problem, to the council contact or contacts responsible for the area where
you located the problem, or other relevant body. Other than the council, who obviously get
your email address, only people we authorise to view the FixMyStreet
administration interface will be able to see your email address and they will
never use it for anything other than to help administer FixMyStreet. Similarly
with email addresses from updates. We will never give or sell your email
address to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law. Your name, given in
the name field, will not be published anywhere unless you let us (if you give
your name elsewhere, e.g. in the public details section, it will be publicly
available).</dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>

        <dt>How do I stop receiving emails from you?</dt>
        <dd>Every alert email we send contains an unsubscribe link at the
bottom for you to stop receiving that alert. After the first questionnaire
email on a report, mentioned above, you have to opt in to receive any further
questionnaire on that report.</dd>

    </dl>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data
files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do
this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so
you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the
website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list
the cookies and services that this site can use.

<h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this
site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand
how we could do it better.

<p>Google Analytics stores information such as what
pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click
on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a
portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We
do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides
providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of
Google Analytics does the same.

<p>We have also enabled the Advertising Features of Google
Analytics. In particular, we use <b>Demographics and Interest
reporting</b> to identify trends in the types of users visiting our
site, which may be used for internal reporting and improvement of
the site content.

<p>In technical speak, this allows Google to collect data about your
traffic via Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">advertising
cookies</a> and
<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous
identifiers</a>, in addition to data collected through a standard
Google Analytics implementation. Regardless of the source of the
data, we strictly adhere to
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409">Google&rsquo;s
policy requirements</a> in our treatment of your data. We do not
facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with
non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google
advertising product or feature.
